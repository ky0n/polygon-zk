[tutorial to issue custom schema](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/issuer/schema/)

Own notes: The Polygon ID is a way to issue verifiable informations.

Example:
* The swissDAO issues a certificate saying "John is great in Solidity development". The swissDAO is the [issuer](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/issuer/issuer-overview/).
* A job agency requires applicants to be good in Solidity. This job agency has a real world trust towards swissDAO. It trust certificates issued by swissDAO. If John applies for a job and showes his certificate, the job agency acts as a [verifier](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/verifier/verifier-overview/), it verifies the swissDAO certificate and confirms that John's Solidity knowledge is sufficient for his desired job.
